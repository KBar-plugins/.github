## 🧠 Overview  

**KBar** is a productivity-focused extension for **Adobe After Effects** that allows users to build fully customized toolbars for faster access to scripts, presets, expressions, and commands. It is designed to reduce repetitive actions and streamline complex workflows.

Instead of navigating through menus or remembering shortcuts, KBar places essential tools exactly where you need them. Buttons can trigger single actions or complete chains of operations, making everyday tasks quicker and more consistent.

Highly adaptable and user-friendly, KBar fits seamlessly into motion design, animation, and compositing pipelines of any scale.
